# System Monitor Tool — Linux System Programming (C++)

A Linux-based System Monitor written in **C++**, using Linux system files such as  
`/proc/stat`, `/proc/meminfo`, and shell utilities to retrieve real-time system resource usage.

This project demonstrates knowledge of:

✅ Linux Internals  
✅ Linux System Programming (LSP)  
✅ Process & resource monitoring  
✅ C++ file handling and system calls  
✅ WSL2 / Ubuntu environment

## ✅ Features

- Real-time **CPU Usage** (calculated from `/proc/stat`)
- Real-time **RAM Usage** (from `/proc/meminfo`)
- **Disk Usage** using `df -h`
- Updates every 2 seconds
- Simple CLI-based interface
- 100% **C++ implementation**
